# Assignment 1: Linear Classifiers

In this assigment, we implement various linear classifiers, namely logistic regression, perceptron, supported vector machine, and softmax, and train them on the [Rice dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/rice-type-classification) and the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

## Result
### Rice Dataset
| Setting | Test Acc. |
|---------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression |  |
| Perceptron |  |
| SVM |  |
| Softmax |  |

### Fashion-MNIST Dataset
| Setting | Test Acc. |
|---------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | Not Applicable |
| Perceptron |  |
